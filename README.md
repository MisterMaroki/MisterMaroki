# My Story


I always had this feeling that being a developer was something that I was destined to do, but I just didn't take it seriously when I learned python in secondary school. I've always been a problem solver and an enjoyer of mathematics, so you'd think that the natural path for me was in development of some kind. 

But no - I went straight into sales after finishing college because I thought life was all about the money... 3 years later, in 2020, when I started building Wordpress sites for small businesses after the pandemic, I was dipping my toe into jQuery and css to try and make a cube spin on a page... 

I continues to spend the next 3 hours reading StackOverflow articles and copy/pasting suggestions to no avail - but I didn't give up. I found it to be very satisfying when I finally got said cube to spin but I had to move back to Wordpress to get actual work done for the clients. I bought Jon Duckett's books on HTML&CSS, JAVASCRIPT&jQUERY and a little app called Mimo - it seemed to come so naturally. 

I enjoy things that have an answer that must be acquired by following patterns of calculations. And so naturally, I stopped coding and started landscaping... LOL! A complete U-turn and a coding hiatus that lasted nearly 1.5-years until I wrote the next lines of code... In JavaScript! I learned on freeCodeCamp and after completing the javascript path there, I started the Scrimba frontend developer career path. Within 3 months I was 85% fluent in React and had built 5 projects which you'll find on my gitHub. Over the next few months I honed in my craft and developed the first 2 versions of my portfolio. One for clients, and one for recruiters. And it's safe to say I love coding! I'm glad I realized this sooner rather than later, and look forward to progressing in the industry with great companies.
