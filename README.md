# My Story


I always had this feeling that being a developer was something that I was destined to do, but I just didn't take it seriously when I learned python in secondary school. I've always been a problem solver and an enjoyer of mathematics, so you'd think that the natural path for me was in development of some kind. 

But no - I went straight into sales after finishing college because I thought life was all about the money...

3 years later, in 2020, when I found myself building Wordpress sites for small businesses after the pandemic, I was dipping my toes into jQuery and css to try and make a cube spin on a page... 

After some time reading StackOverflow articles and copy/pasting suggestions to no avail - it was finlly spinning. I found it to be very satisfying when I finally got said cube to spin but I had to move back to Wordpress to get actual work done for the clients. I bought Jon Duckett's books on HTML&CSS, JAVASCRIPT&jQUERY and a little app called Mimo - it seemed to come so naturally. 

I enjoy things that have an answer that must be acquired by following patterns of calculations. And so naturally, I stopped coding and started landscaping... LOL! A complete U-turn and a coding hiatus that lasted nearly 1.5-years until I wrote the next lines of code... In JavaScript! This time on  freeCodeCamp. After completing the [javascript path](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/) there, I started the [Scrimba frontend developer career path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). Within 3 months I was 85% fluent in React and had built 5 projects which you'll find on my gitHub. Over the next few months I honed in my craft and developed the first 2 versions of my portfolio. And it's safe to say I love coding! I'm glad I realized this sooner rather than later, and look forward to progressing in the industry with great companies.
